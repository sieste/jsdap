# A quick introduction #

Jsdap is composed of 4 separate files: parser.js, xdr.js, api.js and vbscript.js.
If you run `make`, they will be combined and compressed together
with header.js into a single file jsdap.js, which should be used
in your web applications.

The API is as simple as it gets:

```
loadDataset(url, callback [, proxy])
```

This will load the metadata from an OPeNDAP url, and return it to
your callback function as a Javascript object identical to pydap's
JSON response (http://pydap.org/2.x/responses/json.html).

Note that if the server is on a different domain you need to specify
a proxy to handle the requests. There's a simple proxy written in
Python that comes together with jsdap.

```
loadData(url, callback [, proxy])
```

This functions read the data from a `.dods` URL
(`http://example.com/dataset.dods?var1,var2&var3>0)`, returning it
as a nested list. This is the data for the whole dataset, so the
outer list corresponds to the dataset objects, and each contained
list is the data of a given variable, an so on recursively.

There are a couple of demos of increasing complexity in the
[examples](http://jsdap.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/examples/) directory.

# Limitations #

Due to the XHR policy on not allowing cross-domain requests,
you need a proxy to handle external datasets.
